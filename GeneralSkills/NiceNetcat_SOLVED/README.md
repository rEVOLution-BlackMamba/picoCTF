# Nice netcat

## Description 

There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: $ nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342, but it doesn't speak English...

## Approach

I used the command given, it output a lot of numbers. I used this site, https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/numbers-to-letters,   to converte them to letters, they were the ascii code of the letters
